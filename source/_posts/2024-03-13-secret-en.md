## Main Activities and Discoveries

Today was an exciting day in my programming journey! I created a special version of Tic-tac-toe game that combines math with fun. What makes it unique is that players need to solve math equations before they can place their X or O on the board.

## Learning Points and Growth

I learned how to create a PRD (Product Requirements Document) today, which helped me plan my game better. This was an important step in becoming a real programmer! I also learned how to connect my project to the Builder, which was a new experience for me.

## Special Game Features

In my Math Tic-tac-toe game:
- Players must solve math problems to place their marks
- It's not just a regular Tic-tac-toe game - it helps you learn math too!
- I carefully planned it using a PRD before starting to code

## Small Achievements and Progress

I'm proud that I could combine math learning with a fun game. Making a PRD showed me how real programmers plan their work!

## Encouraging Words and Tomorrow's Expectations

You're becoming such a thoughtful programmer! Planning before coding is a great habit. I can't wait to see what new features you'll add to your game tomorrow!
