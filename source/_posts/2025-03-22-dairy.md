## Dear Diary!

Guess what?! Today was SUPER amazing! 🌟 I did so many fun things, I can't wait to tell you all about them!

## My Super Special Day!
- 🎹 I finally got my left hand to play the new piano song right! My teacher said I did great!
- 📚 At the library, I found this really cool book that I can't wait to read under my blanket fort!
- 🍰 The BEST part - I made my very first cake with Daddy! It was so much fun!

## What I Learned Today
Oh my gosh, I learned SO much!
- 🎵 My left hand isn't being silly anymore on the piano - it's actually doing what I want it to do!
- 🧁 I'm like a real baker now! Daddy showed me all these cool things:
  - I got to turn the big oven dial to 350 (that's really hot!)
  - I measured everything super carefully like a scientist
  - I learned this cool trick with a chopstick to check if the cake is ready (it's like magic!)

## My Special Cake Recipe!
I'm writing this down so I never forget my first cake!
What I put in:
- A box of cake mix (the yummy kind!)
- 3 eggs (I only dropped one, but Daddy helped clean it up)
- Some water and oil (Daddy helped me measure)

My Super Secret Tip: Stick a chopstick in the middle - if it comes out clean, your cake is ready for eating! 🎉

## My Big Question
If I could make ANY cake in the whole wide world, I think I would make...
(I'm still thinking about it! Maybe a rainbow unicorn cake that sparkles?)

## What I Want to Do Tomorrow
- 🧁 Make another cake (maybe with sprinkles this time!)
- 🎹 Practice my piano more (I'm getting really good!)
- 📚 Read my new library book in my special reading corner
- 👩‍🍳 Try to be an even better baker!

Love,
