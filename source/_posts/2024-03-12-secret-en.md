## Main Activities and Discoveries

Today, I went to a place called Lake Pleasant. I saw boats there and visited a shop where I discovered interesting doll accessories. Later, while hiking to look for donkeys (though we didn't find any), I discovered a broken bridge and a river. I also collected some shells that I plan to clean when I get home.

## Learning Points and Growth

I learned that different places have their own unique scenery and interesting things to discover. This experience has broadened my horizons.

## Positive Emotional Experiences

I felt joy when I saw the cute doll accessories in the shop. It was a delightful discovery!

## Small Achievements and Progress

I showed bravery by hiking and exploring unknown places. It was an adventure!
