## Dear Diary!

Today was such an AMAZING day at school! 🌟 My brain is buzzing with all the cool things I learned!

## Today's Super Cool Highlights!
- 📐 Learned about angles in math class (they're like secret codes for shapes!)
- 📝 Took a math test (it was tricky but I did it!)
- 📚 Found the MOST INCREDIBLE book about a dragon with sound powers!
- 📚 Read an awesome book about AI and learned about chess-playing computers!

## All The Awesome Things I Learned
- 📐 Angles are everywhere! They're like magical corners that make shapes special
- 🐉 Dragons can have super cool powers - this one could turn into SOUND WAVES!
- 💪 Even when math is hard, I can be brave and try my best

## My Favorite Part About the Dragon Book
Oh my goodness, this dragon is THE COOLEST! It can:
- 🌊 Turn itself into sound waves (how amazing is that?!)
- 💥 Break rocks just by roaring
- 🎵 Make the most beautiful music ever

I wonder if it could teach me how to sing better? 🎤

## My AI Book Reading Adventure! 🤖
📚 "Welcome to AI" Reading Notes
✍️ Author: Owen, Matthieu
📅 Date: Today

📝 Book Summary: WOW! This book taught me something super interesting about computers and chess! Did you know that back in the 1950s, scientists who were working on AI really loved chess? They thought it was a great way to test how smart computers could be! And get this - in 1997, a super-smart computer called Deep Blue actually beat the best chess player in the world! Then in 2016, another AI called AlphaGo won against a really good player named Lee Sedol. After that, Lee Sedol decided to stop playing because he thought humans wouldn't be able to win against AI anymore!

💡 My Discoveries:
- Scientists used to think chess was like a super-brain-test for computers!
- A computer called Deep Blue became like a chess superhero in 1997!
- Another AI called AlphaGo became a champion at a game in 2016!

❓ My Questions:
- Why did scientists think chess was the best way to test if computers were smart?
- Will humans really never be able to beat AI at games like this again?

🔗 Cool Facts I Learned:
- Deep Blue beating the chess master was like a huge milestone for computers!
- AlphaGo winning in 2016 was another HUGE moment in AI history!

🌈 My Big Ideas:
Maybe one day, humans will find a super creative way to beat AI at these games again! I wonder how we could do it? That would be SO COOL! 🌟

## What I Want to Do Tomorrow
- 🏰 Draw a super cool dragon's lair using all the angles I learned about
- 📝 Practice more math so I can be even better next time
- 🎨 Maybe draw my own dragon with special powers
- 📚 Read more of that AMAZING book!

Dear Diary, even though some parts of the math test were tricky, I'm so proud that I didn't give up! And finding that dragon book was like discovering treasure! 💎

I can't wait to use what I learned about angles to make the BEST dragon's lair drawing ever tomorrow! Maybe I'll add some sound waves too, just like my new favorite dragon friend! 🐉✨

Love and dragon roars,
Stella 💖

P.S. Do you think real dragons use geometry to build their lairs? 🤔
