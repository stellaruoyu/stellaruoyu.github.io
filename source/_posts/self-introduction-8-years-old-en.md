Hello everyone! I'm an 8-year-old kid in second grade!

## My School Life

My favorite subject is Math because solving problems feels like playing an exciting game! I also love drawing - it lets me create all the wonderful worlds in my imagination. My mom says my drawings are super creative!

## My After-School Activities

I'm learning badminton and swimming right now. It's so much fun watching the shuttlecock fly back and forth during badminton practice! In swimming class, I love being like a little fish, swimming freely in the water. Even though I was a bit scared at first, I've overcome my fear and become braver!

## My Favorite Books and Movies

My absolute favorite books are the Harry Potter series. I get so excited reading about Harry and his friends' adventures at Hogwarts! Sometimes I imagine getting my own Hogwarts acceptance letter - wouldn't it be amazing to learn magic?

As for my favorite movie, it's definitely Frozen! I'm a huge fan of Queen Elsa - she's not only beautiful but also has magical powers. I can even sing "Let It Go" now, and every time I sing it, I feel like I've become Queen Elsa!

## My Little Wishes

I hope to keep improving myself, do well in my studies, and get better at sports. Most importantly, I want to make more friends and have fun learning and playing together!
